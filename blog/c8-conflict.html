              <p>My girlfriend and I had an emotional conflict over something I said to her. She said she was hurt by my words, and I defended myself by saying it was just the truth. It was about something inconsequential, so inconsequential that I do not remember the reason for it now, but at the time I remember feeling compelled to say what I said to her.</p> 

<p>The source of the conflict was some deep-rooted feelings I had towards her that emerged when I noticed she would do/say the same things that in my view made her a hypocrite. I handled it pretty poorly by accusing her of something much more serious than I intended to, and in turn it hurt her very deeply. It took awhile for me to realize what I had said and done, but at that time it was already too late. You cannot un-say words to someone else. What I did definitely made the conflict worse.</p>

<p>If I could go back, I would definitely have taken back what I said, and maybe initiated the conversation about my feelings in a less accusatory manner. I learned that words can be severely hurtful to people, and to speak carefully at all times.
