              <p>The Internet isn&apos;t called the world wide web for no reason. It&apos;s a global network of computers, and each computer must have a unique address, known as an Internet Protocol, or IP, address. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, either through an ISP or LAN network, your computer may have a temporary or permanent address.
In order to communicate and send signals from one computer to the next, protocol stacks are used in order to translate the alphabetic text to electronic signals. Every computer needs a protocol stack to communicate on the Internet. If you&apos;re curious, you can find more information about your protocol stack if you check out your network options, it&apos;ll say TCP/IP.</p>

<p>So what makes the Internet so vast and full of information? Both the networking and internet infrastructure is builds the backbone of the internet. Network Service Providers, or NSPs, are large networks that are interconnected with each other. They exchange packet traffic, that is what begins to form the complex internet as we know it. Packets find their way across the internet through routing tables that are kept by each router that is connected to the internet. Depending on the connection, the router sends the packets to the different IP addresses either through a default route, or until it reaches an NSP backbone.</p>

<p>In order to access different pages on the web, we use the Doman Name Service, or DNS. This is a database that keeps track of computer&apos;s names and their IP addresses on the Internet. Both the DNS and protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, serve to provide us with the wealth of information that we can access today. The HTTP is the protocol that web browsers use to communicate with each other over the internet.</p>

<p>There are other ways that we communicate and share information on the Internet as well, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP. This is also known as e-mail. Though we have a wide variety of differing connections that all contribute to what the internet is today, one must understand that the internet is ever-changing, and one must continuously be able to adapt to its changes.</p>
