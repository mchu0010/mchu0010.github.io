              <p><strong>Variable Scope</strong></p>

              <p>Variable Scope is where the variable is accessible within a program. There are five different kind of variables within a scope: global variables, class variables, instance variables, local variables, and constants. Each variable has a different symbol at beginning of the variable to represent which variable scope they are. I&rsquo;ll be explaining what each variable scope are and how they work.</p>



<p><strong>GLOBAL VARIABLES</strong>
<p>Global variables begin with the symbol &quot;$&quot; and it may be accessed from anywhere within program. Global variables should be used carefully because they can be written from anywhere. The overuse of global variables can make it difficult to track your bugs in your program. Also, global variables can be changed easily without any warning messages like you would receive from constant variables.</p>

<p><strong>CLASS VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p>Class variables begin with the symbols &quot;@@&quot; and are variables that are shared amongst all instances of a class. They are saved from being passed on an inheritance chain. Class variables are only available to to class methods and not to instance methods. If an object changes the class variable, it will be changed for all instances of the class variable in the program. Class variables can be looked as a global variable within the context of a single class.</p>

<p><strong>INSTANCE VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p>Instance variables are very common just like local variables, and they begin with the symbol &quot;@&quot;. Instance variables are very similar to class variables but instead their value is local to specific instances of an object. Their scope is confined to whatever object “self” refers to. Outside of their scope, instance variables cannot be altered.</p>

<p><strong>CONSTANT VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p>Constant variables begin with an uppercase character and it <i>should</i> only be assigned a value only once. If the value is changed then a warning will appear in the command line. Constants may be declared within a class, but unlike instance variables, they can be accessible out of a class. </p>

<p><strong>LOCAL VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p>Local variables is the most basic variable in Ruby. There is no symbol or designations required before the name. Local variables are accessible from where they were originally declared. For example, if a local variable declared in a method cannot be accessible outside of that loop.</p>
