              <h5>Humility, Challenge, Having a Family

              <p>Having a family is important to me because my family is my support structure. I have a very large and close knit family, and we are always supporting and helping each other during every stage. If I am ever unsure about a decision or need advice, I know that I can count on my family to have my best interests at heart when discussing any issues or decisions to make.</p>

              <p>Humility&#58; 5
              <br>Challenge&#58; 4
              <br>Having a Family&#58; 5 </p>

              <p>The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was friendships. I advised my friend to choose friendships wisely, and to be smart about who you choose to become friends with.</p>

              <p>My values are important to me so of course I feel strongly about them. Humility is a traitthat is incredibly difficult to find in many high-achieving and intelligent people, which makes it even more important to have when you are successful. Having a large and close knit family has taught me to be more inclusive of everyone, and to make sure no one is left out. Facing challenges are important in my development so I can continue to push myself and strive to be better. These values can help mediate stereotype threat because they will remind me to be confident and true to who I am.</p>

              <p>If I am feeling down at DBC I should remind myself how lucky I am to have the supportsystem around me and how fortunate I am to be given the opportunity to attend a bootcamp like DBC. Not many people are brave enough to go through with a career hange if they are unhappy in their current jobs, and Iâ€™ve already completed the first step.</p>
