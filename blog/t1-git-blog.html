              I didn't really know what to expect coming into Dev Bootcamp. I knew that it requires hard work and dedication but these terms are quite abstract. The first week of phase 0 was exciting because it is the start of a journey that I am thrilled to embark on. Yes, there is a lot of work but unlike college courses, the things we learn are directly applicable to what I want to do. I love how DBC really emphasizes on pairing and working together. Although I haven’t had a pair session yet, DBC’s Google+ group is awesome, it seems like everyone is very kind and motivated and wants to help one another succeed. I am now finishing up my first week of Phase 0 which was mainly about learning how use to the command line, Git, and Github.

I first want to discuss version control and what it is and why it is so beneficial to developers. Version control is a software that keeps track of changes you make to a file. It is useful to developers because it allows them to go back to an earlier version of the information, if a serious mistake was made during that change. Version control is most beneficial when collaborating with others because it has the ability to track changes which promotes accountability and makes it easier to find the person who made the change or to find the right person to solve the problems in the materials maintained.

Now this leads us to Git, which is one of the most popular version control softwares out there. Git is a program that allows developers to work on their code from their computers and then pass that code onto a website called GitHub. And now... what is GitHub? We’ll get to that in a second. Git allows you to save different versions of your work as you code by using the commands “git add” and “git commit -m.” A commit a useful tool because it is like a checkpoint where you can go back to and look at the state of your file at that commit.

Now, what is GitHub you may ask? GitHub is an online website where people can store or share their codes and collaborate on projects at the same time without changing the original copy. GitHub allows you to compare changes and and administer user accounts.

1 week down. 18 weeks to go and I cannot wait!
