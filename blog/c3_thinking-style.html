              <p>According to the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz I took, I am a Concrete Random thinker. I realized that before I even started writing this blog, I&rsquo;ve already talked about my trial-and-error approaches in a few of my reflections and that is under the section of Concrete Random&rsquo;s &quot;They learn best when.&quot; I like to be given the opportunity to first try to solve the problem by myself and then pair with others to have a better understanding of the overall solution.</p>

<p>Reflecting back on my Phase 0 experience so far, my biggest struggle would be when I am unable to find the solution to the problem after attempting it myself. I would waste hours trying to figure out the problem on my own by searching on the internet or just reading the material over and over. Usually, I like to solve the problems on my own rather than relying on someone else and that is why I wasn&rsquo;t able to start my pairing until the end of week 2. I knew all along how important pairing is to DBC, but at first I felt so uncomfortable asking other people I don&rsquo;t really know to help me out with the challenges. But after my first GPS with my guide Gary and GPS pair, I feel a lot more comfortable video chatting with others.</p>

<p>Someone with a fixed mindset is stuck with the notion that their level of intelligence cannot be changed and they see failure as a sign of unintelligence. When they are faced with challenges and obstacles, with a fixed mindset they are likely to give up easily and tend to avoid these challenges altogether. A growth intelligence mindset, however, is quite different on all aspects. People who have a growth mindset believe that you can develop your intelligence, and challenges and obstacles are to be embraced and see them as springboards for further learning. Criticism and failure are not seen as marks of unintelligence but as a way to better oneself and improve upon their knowledge. Having a growth mindset would help improve everyday life, particularly for Dev Bootcamp, because it is important to recognize that challenges and obstacles are vital through our learning because they push us to the next level and allow us to learn critically from our mistakes.</p>
