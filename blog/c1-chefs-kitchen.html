              I am excited about DBC based on what Shereef Bishay talked about in the video. He wants us to come in hungry and angry and wanting to code - to take control of our learning process. We are going to come into DBC and meet some of the most important people in our lives with the same passion and goals. Thats a big reason why I wanted be apart of DBC. I want to work with other motivated people who are determined to learn to code more than anything. I believe DBC is more than just a coding bootcamp, they teach you how to be successful by living a healthy style through yoga and the onsite therapist, and improving EQ to better professional and personal relationships.

Like Shereef said, DBC is not a menu where we can come in and buy an entree. We cannot walk in with a consumer mindset and simply take. We have to walk into DBC with kitchen mindset and be in it all together as a team. We need to be in a creator mode and think that this is my experience and I want to make this amazing for myself alongside my cohort. We need to walk in with an open mind to learn new concepts and ideas, also with a sense of knowing that we can really do this and learn a set of tools that will change our lives forever.

I am nervous and excited at the same time, because I have never really been the social butterfly. But I am ready to get out of my comfort zone and do whatever it takes to help me and my cohort succeed and achieve our goals together as a team.
