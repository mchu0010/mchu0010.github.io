              An obvious issue that the tech industry faces is the lack of diversity. Many big companies in northern California like Google, Apple, Facebook and Linkedin are just a few of the companies without a diversified workplace. The majority of the work force in the tech industry are largely white and male, and with little to no diversity in the tech industry, it is in danger of a consumer disconnect with a diverse world.

I believe a away to slowly improve this problem, it will need to start with the biggest tech companies and even coding bootcamps. They should actively solicit more females employees, students, and people of other races (like hispanic and blacks) and market towards them more so, but no as a consumer but as an employee.

If the trend continues on where it is white male dominated, the products that are created may no longer appeal to the masses which could lead to an overall lowering of consumer demand. Diversity is important not only in the tech industry, but every industry because it fosters creativity and open-mindedness  that is important for the overall health of respective industries.
