              <p>Before I started this bootcamp, I knew that pair programming is very important to Dev Bootcamp because it helps foster collaboration. We’ve been pairing 2 to 4 times a week since the beginning, and today I am going to talk about my experience with pair programming.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve really enjoyed my pairing sessions that I’ve had with my fellow boots. All my pairing partners have been helpful and always asked if I understood the purpose of each method and how it works in general. It’s a great way to learn and it helped me look at solving the challenges from a different perspective for better or for worse. It’s nice to see how the others go about their challenges and pseudo codes than how I do it. Overall I think pairing is a great way to learn as long as you and partner are not afraid to ask questions and to make sure both are doing equal amount of work.</p>

<p>Another important part of pairing is giving and receiving good feedback. I’ve received many feedbacks and most have very positive and helpful. I learned that I tend to jump into a program without completing my pseudocode and also that I need to be more vocal about switching rolls. I’m very happy that I’ve received these great actionable feedback because now I can try to improve on both of those so that my partner and I can do equal amount work. Also some good feedback about how I pair is that, I always ask if my partner understand what we’re doing every time we use a new method. I think the most difficult part of feedbacks is giving good feedback. I have hard time writing good feedback because I always think that my partners are so good and that there’s nothing else I think they can improve on. I usually don’t have anything bad to say about them so it’s hard to give actionable feedback.</p>
