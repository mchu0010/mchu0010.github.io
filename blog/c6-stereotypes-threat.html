              <p>Stereotype threat and our social awareness and understanding of it is important so that we as a group are all on the same field. As an Asian-American, our stereotype is the &quot;Model Minority&quot;. At first glance, many people may consider it as a blessing: &quot;you&rsquo;re Asian, you&rsquo;re so smart&quot;, or &quot;you must do well, your parents force you to succeed&quot;. The notions associated with Asian Americans are typically ones surrounding the ideas of overachieving and highly successful minority group. However, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost and blend in. Being Asian doesn&rsquo;t mean being smart. It can be difficult to get the help you need because its assumed that you understand to a certain degree, and compared to your fellow Asians, its shameful to admit that sometimes you are not up to par. Although it is a little reversed in the concept, stereotype threat has appeared in my experience in the opposite way; it allows me to hide behind the impression that I know what I&rsquo;m doing, even though sometimes I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s important that we are able to address it early on both individually within ourselves and in others. Positive reinforcement about our work and an extra helping hand &#40;or brain&#41; will go a long way in battling stereotype threats. Being frank and honest about what I do and do not understand will help me overcome any symptoms of it and help me to move forward with full confidence.</p>
